##Artista - Website Theme

A single page website for a budding artist with modals designed to act like pages. 

A budding artist should not have to pay a huge amount for getting a website built. 

When there are online portfolio sites like _Behance_ and _Dribble_ and market places like _Fine Art America_ and _Saatchi Art_, an artist who is just beginning to build a reputation can use this code with minimal editing and support. 

Get a minimal hosting plan, upload this code, edit the content and add portfolio and market place links, and you are good to go.
